The Pros and Cons of French Press Coffee. French press makes coffee by steeping the grounds in hot water, and then pressing the grounds out. After the drip coffee maker, it is one of the easiest, least time-consuming ways to make a great cup of coffee. Also, unlike pour over and the Aeropress, it makes it easy to brew coffee for several people at once. But it is prone to bitterness and oiliness, since the coffee is sitting directly on the grounds for a period of time, and this can turn people off.
